This thesis is part of the project which aims to constract a learning factory with mobile and manipulator robot components. The goal of the thesis is to develop software for autonomous manipulator robots using ROS and establish wireless connections with the other components of the learning factory. This repository contains two submodules that were created to control a kitting station. The detailed instruction can be found in the kitting_station repository and dual_xarm7_moveit_config repository.
